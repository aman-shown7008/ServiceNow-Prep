1.  What is Scripting? Uses.
A.  Scripting in ServiceNow means writing small pieces of JavaScript code to make things work the way you want inside the platform.
    It helps you automate tasks, control form behavior, or customize the system.

    What It can do-
   🔹Scripting can be done in servicenow to customize the instance of JS.
   🔹ServiceNow provide classes and methods which can be used to enhance and customize the platform functionality.
   🔹The JS used in servicenow is based on mozilla rhino.
    When to use it-
   🔹When you need to add features beyond the default (out-of-the-box) functionality.
   🔹When you need to integrate ServiceNow with other applications or systems.
   🔹When you want to automate manual tasks and workflows.
    When to not use it-
   🔹To make a field read-only → use UI Policy
   🔹To hide a field when the form loads → use UI Policy or Form Layout
   🔹To set a field value when the assignment group changes → use Data Policy or UI Policy with conditions
    Uses- 
   🔹To auto-fill fields.
   🔹To hide/show things on a form.
   🔹To send notifications.
   🔹To update records automatically.
   🔹To do calculations.
    Types of Scripting-
    1️⃣Client-Side Scripting.
    2️⃣Server-Side Scripting.
    3️⃣Mid-Server Scripting.



2.  What is Glide Classes? Uses.
A.  Glide classes are special built-in JavaScript classes provided by ServiceNow that help you interact with the platform, such as reading or updating records, handling dates, managing sessions, and more.
    They are only available inside ServiceNow and are used mostly in server-side scripting.
    Use-Cases-
    🔹Access and modify database records.
    🔹Get current user/session info.
    🔹Work with dates/times.
    🔹Send emails or messages.
    🔹Log info for debugging.
    Server-Side Glide Classes-
    | Glide Class          | Purpose                                            |
    | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
    | `GlideRecord`        | Read/write records in tables (like SQL in JS)      |
    | `GlideSystem (gs)`   | Utility methods like logging, date/time, user info |
    | `GlideDateTime`      | Work with dates and times                          |

    | `GlideAjax`          | Call server-side code from client-side             |
    | `GlideForm (g_form)` | Used in client scripts to change form fields       |
    | `GlideEmailOutbound` | Send emails using scripts                          |



3.  What is Client Side Scripting? UseCase.
A.  Client-side scripting runs in the user's browser and is used to control how forms behave on the UI (form layout, field visibility, validation, etc.)
    Ex - Show an alert when the form loads.
         Validate the "From Date" or other field inputs.
         Show/Hide specific choices in dropdown fields.
         Show/Hide sections on the form.
         Set a field value based on another field.
         Show a confirmation message on form submit.
    Where to use it?
    🔹UI Policies – Make fields visible, read-only, or mandatory.
    🔹Client Scripts – Write JavaScript for form behavior.
    🔹UI Actions – Add buttons or links to forms.
    🔹UI Context Menus – Add custom right-click options.
    🔹Validation Scripts – Check field values before submission.

4.  What is Client Side API & Methods?
A.  GlideAjax - It is used to call server side code from client.
                Its instance is called with GlideAjax constructor. 
                It is used for Client Scripting.
                Syntax - var ga = new GlideAjax(<Script Include>),
    GlideForm - It is used to customize forms and perform some activities on form.
                By g_form Object we can access GlideForm methods.
                It is used only in Client,
                Syntax - g_form.<GlideFormMethod>(<Parameter>),
    GlideUser - It is used to get the information about the logged in User. 
                By g_user Object we can access GlideUser methods.
                It is used only in client.
                Syntax - g_user.<GlideUserMethods()>,
    GlideDialogWindow - It is used for displaying a dialog in the current window and frame.
                        It is used only in client, 
    GlideModal.



5.  What is Glide Form?
A.  GlideForm (accessed using g_form) is a client-side API in ServiceNow used to control and interact with fields, sections, and form behavior in real-time on the form UI.
    It allows you to:
    🔹Show/hide fields.
    🔹Set/get field values.
    🔹Make fields mandatory or read-only.
    🔹Display messages.
    g_form is only available in Client Scripts, UI Policies, and Client-side scripting contexts.
    Common g_form Methods:
    addDecoration(), addErrorMessage(), 


6.  What is Server Side Scripting? UseCase.
A.  Server-side scripting in ServiceNow runs on the server and database, not in the user's browser.
    It is used to manage data, enforce rules, send emails, and integrate with external systems.

7.  What is Client scripting?
A.  Client Scripting is used to manage forms and form fields in real-time.
    It runs in the user’s browser and enhances the user experience by dynamically responding to form actions.
    When to use it-

    🔹 Show a message when a field value changes
    🔹 Set a field value based on another field’s input
