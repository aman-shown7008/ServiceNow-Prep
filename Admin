1.  Ways to interact with Service Now.
A.  UI, Mobile Apps, Portal Interface.



2.  List, Filter & Forms.
A.  A role gives access to specific applications, modules, and data inside the ServiceNow instance.
    For example:
    The itil role allows users to work with incidents and tasks.
    The admin role allows full access to almost everything.
    The catalog_admin role allows managing the service catalog.



3.  Name two baseline system roles.
A.  Two Baseline System Roles in ServiceNow:
    admin - 
    Has full control over the entire ServiceNow platform.
    Can create, modify, and delete tables, scripts, roles, users, and all configurations.
    Automatically inherits all other roles.
    itil - 
    Stands for IT Infrastructure Library.
    Used by IT service desk agents.
    Grants access to Incident, Problem, Change, and Task tables.
    Common role for handling day-to-day ITSM processes.



4.  What is Incident we select in dropdown on Tables.
A.  The dropdown pulls data from the incident table.
    It's a reference field, which stores a sys_id of the selected incident record behind the scenes.
    What you see in the dropdown is typically the Incident Number (like INC0012345).

    When you select "Incident" from a dropdown, you're usually choosing a specific incident record to link or reference in another table or form.



5.  Uses of Service Desk Application.
A.  Caller - All users of our System.
    Incident - The issues that are in Priority.
    Knowledge - We can access different racats.
    My Work - Any thing that assign to you.
    My Group Works - Any thing that assign to your group.
    My Approvals - 



6.  LifeCycle of Article - 
A.  Article is created -> Sent for Approval -> Article is published -> Article is requested to retired -> Sent for Approval -> Article is Retired.



7.  What is Tables?
A.  A table is a collection of records in the database where information can be entered tables have different rows and these indivtual rows correspond to a record in a table. It also have columns which correspond to a field in a record or row.
    Row is a racket which shows the details of the racket in the forms of field and stores the data.
    Types of tables-
    Base Table, Extended Tables, Core Tables, Custom Tables.



8.  What is Dictionary?
A.  It shows list of all column of all the tables of your instance have which is also called dictionary.
    The Dictionary is the only place where you define the data type and field-level properties like length, default value, read-only, mandatory (system-enforced), reference relationships, and field labels at the table schema level.
    A Dictionary Entry in ServiceNow defines how a field behaves in a table: its type, length, mandatory setting, default value, display setting, etc.
    Test-Case - 
    Create a new field phone_number in the User table with 10 length only.



9.  What is Fields?
A.  It is a column of tables which stores the actual data it can be of different types like string choice reference true OR false the major attribute.



10. What is Reports?
A.  Reports - Reports in ServiceNow help you see and understand your data in a visual way — like charts, tables, and graphs.
    Types of Reports - 
    Bars - Compare individual or aggregate scores across data dimensions.
    Pies and Donuts - Pies and Donuts show the proportions that make up a whole.
    Time series - Visualize data over time.
    Multidimensional reports - Visualize data using multiple dimensions.
    Scores - Visualize a single data point.
    Other -  There are even more chart types to choose from.
             You use reports to answer questions like:
             How many incidents were created this month?
             Which team has the most tasks?
             What’s the average resolution time?
    5 - Make a report on all the open incident for each month.
    


11. What is Notification?
A.  Notification - A Notification in ServiceNow is used to automatically send emails when certain conditions are met — like a record is created, updated, or a specific field changes.
    There are three sections to configure in a Notification.
    When to send
    Who will receive
    What it will contain
    Use-Case:
    3 - When an incident state changes from on hold to in progress send a notification to caller.
    23 -Create a report for Average Open Time of Incidents in ServiceNow.
    12 -A VIP's manger should always know whenever incident is created.



12. What is UI Policy? 
A.  UI Policy is for the user interface only, to control how the form looks and behaves for the user — like hiding, showing, making fields mandatory/read-only.
    Make a field mandatory, read-only, or hidden based on conditions.
    Test-Case-
    Make Impact Mandatory if Category is Network.
    Hide Subcategory if our Category is Network.
    https://dev347964.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/sys_ui_policy.do%3Fsys_id%3D7ee7dd61c3b52610dbc11c65e4013195%26sysparm_view%3D%26sysparm_domain%3Dnull%26sysparm_domain_scope%3Dnull

    Data Policy is more powerful for backend validation — it enforces rules on any data entry method, whether it's through the UI, import set, or REST API. It helps keep the data clean and consistent.


    On the other hand, Data Policy is used when we want to enforce field-level rules on the server side — meaning the rules apply no matter how the data is coming in (UI form, REST API, import sets, or background scripts).
    Data Policy ensures data consistency across all sources, not just the UI.
    Like: If we make “Configuration Item” mandatory via Data Policy when Category = Network, it will block the record from being saved, even if it was created through API or import — not just the form.
