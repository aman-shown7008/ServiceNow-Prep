Q.  What is Service Catalog?
A.  The Service Catalog is a request ordering system in ServiceNow that allows users to request services and products offered by different departments within an organization.
    Example:
    The Hosting Team provides cloud computing services where users can request cloud servers.
    The Windows Team offers a password reset service for users to reset their Windows passwords.
    ✅Benefits of Service Catalog
    Acts like an Amazon-like portal for internal services.
    A one-stop shop to access various services from different departments.
    Categorized items help users find the correct service easily.
    Supports multiple catalogs for organizing services.

    ✅Service Catalog Categories
    Services and products are grouped into logical categories for better organization.
    Ex Categories: Hardware, Software, Desktops.

    ✅Catalog Items
    These are the actual services or products offered, represented as forms users fill out.
    Submitting a form creates related tasks for fulfillment teams.

    ✅Key Components of Service Catalog
    Order – A single catalog item (e.g., Laptop, Monitor).
    Order Guide – A bundle of items requested together (e.g., Laptop + Charger for new employee onboarding).
    Record Producer – A form to create records in existing tables (e.g., Incident, Change) with selected fields.

    Order Form – The interface users fill with inputs (variables).
    Variables & Variable Sets – Fields that capture user inputs during the request.

    ✅Ordering Process
    Workflows: Admin-defined processes including approvals, assignments, and scripts for handling requests.
    Flows: No-code/low-code drag-and-drop designer for automating request processing.

    ✅Request Output
    When a user submits a catalog request:
    A Request [sc_request] record is created.
    This request can generate related Requested Items [sc_req_item] and Tasks [sc_task] for fulfillment.
